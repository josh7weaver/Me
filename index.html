          <p>Gary Alberts needed to sell his truck covers online. Armed with one web design class, I decided that Ecommerce shouldn't be a big deal. I was wrong. Although I had learned the basics of HTML/CSS in my web design course, the shopping cart solution I decided to implement for the site was written in PHP, and the learning curve was sharp, but I managed to get everything working, from tweaking the theme to registering SSL certs. whew!</p>

              <p>The White Rose Gallery is the internet home of a portfolio/informational site for Sandy and Becky, artists in Charlotte. They needed an inexpensive presence on the web that they could update. So, I modified a flash template to suit her needs. Since she needed to be able to update the page herself, I used actionscript to pull in the content from a file, which allows her to update the flash template by simply editing a text file. The design is horid, but the code works! Its still running at <em>http://thewhiterosegallery.com/</em>

                 They needed social marketing integration and we gave them share button functionality that connected them to 12 of the largest social networks on the web. They needed the ability to accept donations, and we set up a secure system to receive donations. They needed rich media content to communicate their mission visually, and we integrated flv and vimeo videos. They needed to be able to edit and update their content frequently and easily, and we gave them an open source content management system that requires almost no technical knowledge to use.

              <img src="img/wp-sm.png" alt="Wordpress" class="pull-left">
              <p>
                 Around this time I started getting into Wordpress. Its free and there's a great community! (I didn't realize yet what a pain it is to template with.) I worked with a designer (who will remain unnamed) and handled all the front end development on the sites as well as setting up the server and DB. I was doing a lot of hacking in PHP for these sites.
                 The church websites involved:
                 <ul>
                  <li>Creating a page to display calander information from Google Cal</li>
                  <li>Setting up custom content types</li>
                  <li>Creating a custom loop and template for the homepage</li>
                  <li>Creating a custom code to create a sermon archive page with links to audio files and video (if they existed)</li>
                  <li>some fancy frills in JQuery</li>
                 </ul>
                 
                 <br />

                 I built a website on Wordpress for Freedom Fellowship Church, Kingsway Church, and for a startup of mine (that failed) called College Stuff Swap.

              <p>
                 Up until now at TechMuscle my primary role had been in Quality Assurance. So the most fun I had was writing some code to test the forms on our sites. Over the summer I had more time to work, so they let me have a shot at doing project management for all the flash pieces that were being made for a new launch of Tresemme.com. This involved:
                 <ul>
                  <li>Interfacing between devs (internally), Adam at the Flash Development company, Tresemme brand reps, and Giant Squid (a marketing/design agency)</li>
                  <li>Making sure the right flashvars were present</li>
                  <li>Making sure Adam knew the requirements</li>
                 </ul>
              <br />
              I really enjoyed this work. So much in fact, that I soon got a promotion! (more on that next)

              <p>
                 Okay, so it wasn't that hostile. In the fall TechMuscle got a contract for all the production updates for all the Tresemme brands (they have brands in just about every country!) and I stepped into the role of project manager for all work requests and support requests from the brand. Part of the fun of this work was:
                 <ul>
                  <li>Making sure ALL assets for the Mercedes-Benz Fashion week were properly processed and added to the website. We had to turn the assets around same day.</li>
                  <li>Managing minions who did my bidding and performed the updates</li>
                  <li>Translating between the devs and the client (no small task!)</li>
                  <li>Working with people who make shampoo you probably use :)</li>
                 </ul>

                 I did this from May of 2012 to June of 2013 when I left the company.

                 After working with wordpress for several years I got tired of writing REALLY complicated if statements and query modifiers to the loop to create custom pages, and discovered Expression Engine. I used Expression Engine for the Student Government Association's (SGA) new website. Working with designers and a developer in the UK I got to see how an EE site is set up, and got to work with global variables as well as the templating code they provide. A breath of fresh air after wordpress!
